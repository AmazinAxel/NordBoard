# Nord themed custom split keyboard

Column staggered nord-themed Corne-based split keyboard

Design choices:

- Choc v1 switches for reduced strain/travel distance and less noise
  - Transparent keycaps for aesthetics
  - Blue switches for Nord look
- No row stagger and good column stagger for ergonomics
- Chocolate [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) layout since its popular and has good support
- No LEDs or rotary encoders or OLED displays! These are gimmicks and add unnecessary cost
